# TicTacToe
TicTacToe Game for OOPS Python 

This project involves building a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python, where players can engage in a classic 3x3 grid match through the command line. The project utilizes Pythonâ€™s time and math modules to enhance gameplay, adding features like a timer for player turns and random elements for determining the first move. The game incorporates continual practice with nested if statements, allowing players to input their choices, validate moves, and check for winning conditions efficiently.
This project is designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts like loops, functions, and conditional logic, while providing an engaging and interactive game experience.
